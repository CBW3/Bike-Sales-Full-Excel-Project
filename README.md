# Bike-Sales-Full-Excel-Project
I analyze a dataset pertaining to bike sales in Excel. 

The first thing I do the data is clean the dataset. 

In doing so, I add filters to columns, remove 26 duplicates, and change some information such as 
M & S to Married & Single, M & F to Male & Female, change income column data type to currency 
and create a new column labeled age brackets to seperate out the large variation in the age information. 

After cleaning the dataset, I then begin to analyze the dataset.

In doing so, I create pivot tables, pivot charts, and ultimately create a dynamic dashboard with slicers
with respect to region, occupation, education level, and marital status to sort & filter through important information.
